 MONGO
 ======================================
 
 You can close Mongo with ctrl + c

If you leave it running then Cloud 9 could timeout and cause mongo to crash. If this happens, try the following steps to repair it.

From the command line, run:

    cd ~
    ./mongod --repair

If you're still having trouble getting it to run then find the /data directory (it should be inside of ~) and cd into it. Once inside, run rm mongod.lock then cd back into ~ and run ./mongod again (see below).

    cd ~/data
    rm mongod.lock
    cd
    ./mongod

If you continue to have difficulties with this then please open up a new discussion so we can assist you.

As a side note: In the Mongo Shell Basics video you'll see Colt use the show collections command which will show something called system.indexes . This will no longer show up in the latest versions of MongoDB. You can read more about this here.
